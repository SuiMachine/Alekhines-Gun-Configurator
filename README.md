Alekhine's Gun Configurator (unofficial)
============
It's a simple program for editing the display settings of Alekhine's Gun. I doubt, I'll be developing it further. It's for the most part useless with a possible exception of solving with game choosing too high resolution at the startup.

Use it on your own responsibility. Copying, creating deriritive work out of its code, distributing it etc. is fine, as long as you're not charging money for it (with the exception of fully optional donations).
